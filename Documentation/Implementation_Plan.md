# Implementation Plan for AI-Powered Bioinformatics MCP Platform

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
1. Set up development environment with TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL
2. Implement core MCP server following protocol specifications
3. Create authentication service with JWT/OAuth2 support
4. Develop initial API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
5. Build container orchestration foundation with Docker/Kubernetes

## Phase 2: Tool Integration (Months 4-6)
1. Create standardized tool registration system
2. Implement adapters for priority bioinformatics tools:
   - Start with sequence analysis (BLAST)
   - Add structural analysis (AlphaFold)
   - Integrate basic genomics pipelines (BWA)
3. Develop input validation and result formatting services
4. Build monitoring for tool performance

## Phase 3: Workflow Engine (Months 7-9)
1. Integrate with Galaxy for web-based workflows
2. Add support for Nextflow scripts
3. Implement job queuing and resource management
4. Create progress monitoring and visualization components
5. Develop data lifecycle management for temporary results

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Months 10-12)
1. Implement interactive sessions with notebook-like interfaces
2. Add collaboration features (shared workspaces)
3. Develop version control for workflows and results
4. Create comprehensive security measures:
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Compliance features
   - Audit trails
5. Optimize performance for high-throughput operations
6. Complete user documentation and examples

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (Ongoing)
1. Conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end)
2. Gather user feedback and implement improvements
3. Optimize for scale (horizontal and vertical)
4. Establish maintenance and update protocols
