- Set up persistent storage configuration
- Implement scaling policies

### Deliverables:
- Complete container orchestration setup
- Deployment manifests for Kubernetes
- Local development environment with Docker Compose
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and tests
- Documentation for deployment and scaling

## Technology Selection Details

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS (built on Node.js with TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM for data modeling
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with JWT and OAuth2 strategies
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI with NestJS integration
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker with Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API testing

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables according to `.env.example`
4. Start the development database with `docker-compose up -d postgres`
5. Run the development server with `npm run start:dev`

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Upon completion of Phase 1, we'll have a solid foundation with:
- A working MCP server capable of executing tools
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Containerized deployment setup

This will provide the infrastructure needed to move into Phase 2, where we'll focus on integrating specific bioinformatics tools and developing the specialized adapters they require.
